### **Accessing Enpoints Using Postman**
1. To download Postman on your personal machine, go to the [Postman downloads page](https://www.postman.com/downloads/)
2. Install and open Postman
**(For the following instructions, make sure your database is up to date and the API is running, see previous steps)**
* To view a list of all pets: send a GET request at the URL: `http://localhost:5000/api/Pets`
* To view a single pet: send a Get request at the URL: `http://localhost:5000/api/Pets/1` (note: the last number is the id of the pet record you would like to see)
* To create a new pet record, send a POST request to the following URL: `http://localhost:5000/api/Pets`
    1. Click on the Body tab, select Raw, and in the dropdown menu select JSON.
    2. Create your animal using the following format:
```
{
    "type":"Cat",
    "name":"Harold Dunphy",
    "breed":"Domestic Shorthair",
    "age":8,
    "gender":"Male",
    "color":"brown",
    "intact":true
}
```
* To edit a pet record, send a POST request to the following URL: `http://localhost:5000/api/Pets/1` (note: the last number is the id of the pet record you would like to change) Follow the same steps as listed above for creating a new record. Be sure to include all of the properties and just leave the ones that aren't changing the same.
